## Overview

This project is a solution to the QR Code Component challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal of this challenge was to build a QR code component that matches the provided design as closely as possible. The component is a simple yet essential part of many web applications, and this exercise aimed to hone my HTML and CSS skills by implementing it.

## My process

1. Analyzing the design
2. Building the HTML structure
3. Styling With CSS
4. Adding Responsive Design
5. Testing and Refinement

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I avoided using the flex box to challenge my skill on how to position elements inside the containing element. And it was a little bit challenging. Especially when it comes to making it responsive.

```html
<body>

  <div class="container">
    
    <div class="qr-code">
      <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code">
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
      <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>
  </div>

```
```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    height: calc(569px + 12px + 200px);
    background-color: var(--Light-gray);
}

.container {
    width: 375px;
    height: fit-content;
    text-align: center;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    background-color: var(--White);
    border-radius: 20px;
    margin-top: 80px;
}
```

### Continued development

I've understood that I need to work on more projects and enhance my skills on positionining elements accurately. Therefor I will engage on such projects that will help me to do that in the future.
